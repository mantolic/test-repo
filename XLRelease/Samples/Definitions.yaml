        \ user. Go to the [Profile](#/profile) and enter the email address. Then press\

        type: xlrelease.Task
        description: "When creating release templates, you will add tasks that contain\
          \ information that can vary based on the release. Also, you may have one\
          \ generic release template that can be used for the release process of several\
          \ applications. This reusability is an important feature of of XL Release\
          \ because it ensures that you create a template once, and then reuse that\
          \ template for each application release.\n\nFor example, let's say you've\
          \ completed your release template, capturing all of the tasks required to\
          \ release your application. In the template, the application name is the\
          \ only unique value that needs to be defined for each release. This is where\
          \ variables come into play. A variable allows you to put a placeholder in\
          \ tasks and replace it with the actual application name in the release.\n\
          \nYou can use variables in many areas of XL Release, including titles, descriptions,\
          \ and fields. You use variables as placeholders when you are creating the\
          \ template and define their values when the release starts or while the\
          \ release is running.\n\nNow that you understand more about variables, you\
          \ can see that a best practice for creating a template in XL Release is\
          \ to look for areas of overlap in your application release processes. If\
          \ you can consolidate different application release templates into one template\
          \ using variables, you'll help minimize the overhead your team needs to\
          \ manage many release templates."

        \ release represents a number of tasks with people working on it. Release\
        \ allows you to plan, track and execute releases automatically and acts as\
        \ a single source of truth for all people involved to make the release a success.\n\
        \nA **task** can be either some activity done by a person, or an automated\
        \ task that will integrate with other systems or run a script. Release makes\
        \ it easy to model your current process and to transition gradually to a more\
        \ automated procedure.\n\nThere are two types of tasks that are assigned to\
        \ people: the manual task (such as this one), which indicates that something\
        \ has to be done by somebody.\n\nThe other one is a **Gate**, which indicates\
        \ a checkpoint in the release, i.e. a set of conditions that need to be met\
        \ for the release to continue.\n\nClick on **Complete** on this task to see\
